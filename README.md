#Stress-Detection-Using-ML

Stress Detection Project Using Machine Learning

Project Description -- Stress, tension, and misery are undermining the psychological well-being of individuals.Each individual has a justification behind having an unpleasant life. Individuals frequently discuss their thoughts via web-based entertainment stages like on Instagram as posts and stories,and on Reddit through requesting ideas about their life on subreddits. In the beyond couple of years, many substance makers have approached to make content to assist individuals with their psychological wellness.Numerous associations can utilize pressure discovery to find which virtual entertainment clients are focused on to rapidly help them.Stress discovery is a difficult undertaking, as there are so many words that can be utilized by individuals on their posts that can show regardless of whether an individual is having mental pressure.
                  The dataset Iâ€™m utilizing for this errand contains information presented on subreddits related 
                  on emotional wellness. This dataset contains different emotional well-being issues shared by 
                  individuals about their life.

                 People often share their feelings on social media platforms. Many organizations can use 
                 stress detection to find which social media users are stressed to help them quickly. 

Machine Learning -- Machine learning is the process of making systems that learn and improve by themselves, by being specifically programmed.

              The ultimate goal of machine learning is to design algorithms that 
              automatically help a system gather data and use that data to learn more. 
              Systems are expected to look for patterns in the data collected and use 
              them to make vital decisions for themselves.
